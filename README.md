# Plants_Disease_Detection

This project utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with TensorFlow to help farmers identify potential plant diseases by analyzing leaf conditions. The current version is trained specifically for classifying diseases in potato leaves, with plans to expand and include models for other plants in the future.
